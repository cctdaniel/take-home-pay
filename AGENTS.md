## Project Overview

**Take Home Pay Calculator** — A Next.js web application for calculating take-home salary after taxes and deductions. Supported countries are defined by the single registry in `lib/countries/registry.ts`; do not duplicate the current country list in this file.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript 5
- **UI:** React 19, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Fonts:** Geist Sans/Mono

## URL Structure

Each supported country has its own route for SEO:

- `/{country-code-lowercase}` is generated from `SUPPORTED_COUNTRIES` in `lib/countries/registry.ts`
- `app/[country]/page.tsx` uses `generateStaticParams()` to statically generate all registry countries
- `/compare` is the static compare flow
- Root `/` redirects to `/us` (default country)
- Country selector navigates to the selected country's route
- Each page has country-specific metadata (title, description, keywords) sourced from `lib/countries/country-page-content.ts`

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server (localhost:3000)
npm run build    # Production build
npm run start    # Start production server
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

## Architecture

### Routing Pattern

The app uses Next.js dynamic routes with static generation:

1. `app/[country]/page.tsx` — Dynamic route for all countries
2. `generateStaticParams()` — Pre-renders pages for all supported countries at build time
3. `generateMetadata()` — Sets country-specific SEO metadata per page

### Multi-Country Calculator Pattern

The codebase uses a registry pattern for country support:

1. **Registry** (`lib/countries/registry.ts`) — Single ordered `COUNTRY_REGISTRY` list. `SUPPORTED_COUNTRIES`, calculator lookup, and `COUNTRY_CONFIGS` are derived from it.
2. **Country Calculator Interface** (`lib/countries/types.ts`) — Each country implements `CountryCalculator`
3. **Country Page Content** (`lib/countries/country-page-content.ts`) — Country SEO descriptions, keywords, and header copy
4. **Country Implementations** — `/lib/countries/{country-code}/`

### Reusable Calculator UI Pattern

Country option UIs should compose shared controls instead of duplicating labels, grids, parsing, and select markup:

- Use `CalculatorFieldGrid` for option layouts.
- Use `PayFrequencyField` for pay frequency.
- Use `SelectField` for string enums such as residency, filing status, state/region, and regimes.
- Use `BooleanSelectField` for yes/no choices.
- Use `NumberField` for bounded numeric inputs such as age. It keeps an editable string draft, allows temporarily empty values, and clamps min/max on blur.
- Use `CurrencyAmountField` for free-form annual currency amounts.
- Use `ContributionSlider` from `components/ui/contribution-slider.tsx` for bounded contribution/deduction amounts with max toggles.
- Use `InfoPanel` for repeated note/tip callouts.

For annual currency inputs, decide the control from the modeled legal or calculator limit:

- If an official or modeled maximum exists for a user-entered contribution, deduction, relief, credit, or qualifying expense, use `ContributionSlider` and clamp the hook setter and calculator logic to the same maximum.
- If a contribution has a contribution/payment cap and a separate tax-relief cap, use the contribution/payment cap as the slider max and explain the lower relief cap in the description or results copy. Do not use the relief cap as the slider max unless the contribution itself is legally capped there.
- If several inputs share a combined cap, keep each input as a `ContributionSlider`, show the remaining/shared cap or an over-cap warning, and cap the deductible amount in the calculator.
- Use `CurrencyAmountField` only when the amount is genuinely free-form or no credible cap is modeled. If an official cap is discovered, add it to country constants and switch the UI to `ContributionSlider`.

Do not introduce a country-specific version of these controls unless the shared primitive cannot model the interaction. If a new country needs the same concept (for example health insurance, pension, CPF-style savings, or retirement contributions), use the same shared control type and visual language as existing countries.

Mobile note: `Input` and `Select` intentionally render at 16px on mobile (`text-base sm:text-sm`) to avoid iOS Safari focus zoom. Do not override calculator inputs below 16px on mobile.

### Tax Calculation Flow

```
URL (/{country-code}) → Country Page → MultiCountryCalculator → Country Calculator → Tax Breakdown → Results Display
```

Compare flow:

```
/compare → Questionnaire → FX conversion → Country Calculator → Ranked Results + Snapshot
```

Each country calculator handles country-specific combinations of:

- Income tax
- Statutory payroll, pension, social insurance, or savings contributions
- Deductions and contributions
- Tax reliefs

### State Management

- Custom hooks in `/hooks/` manage calculator state
- `use-multi-country-calculator.ts` accepts country as parameter (from URL)
- Country changes trigger navigation, not state updates
- Uses `useMemo` for memoized calculations
- Default gross salary should come from each calculator's `getDefaultInputs()`, not a separate per-country map in the hook

## Adding a New Country

1. Create directory: `lib/countries/{country-code}/`
2. Implement `CountryCalculator` interface in `calculator.ts`
3. Define tax brackets in `constants/`
4. Export via `config.ts` and `index.ts`
5. Add country-specific input, contribution, tax, and breakdown types near the country implementation. Prefer `lib/countries/{country-code}/types.ts` with TypeScript module augmentation for `CountryCodeMap`, `CurrencyCodeMap`, `ContributionInputMap`, `CalculatorInputMap`, `TaxBreakdownMap`, and `CountrySpecificBreakdownMap`. Edit `lib/countries/types.ts` only for genuinely shared primitives.
6. Register in `lib/countries/registry.ts` by importing the calculator and adding one `COUNTRY_REGISTRY` entry. Do not manually edit derived `SUPPORTED_COUNTRIES` or `COUNTRY_CONFIGS`.
7. Add UI components in `components/calculator/`, composing shared fields from `calculator-fields.tsx`
8. Update `use-multi-country-calculator.ts` only for truly country-specific state, input assembly, and setters. Use `getDefaultInputs()` for default gross salary.
9. Add country metadata overrides in `lib/countries/country-page-content.ts` only when the generic metadata from country config is not good enough:
   - `COUNTRY_DESCRIPTIONS`
   - `COUNTRY_KEYWORDS`
   - `COUNTRY_HEADER_INFO`
10. Add country section to `components/calculator/seo-tax-info.tsx`
11. Update compare flow:
    - Extend `hooks/use-country-comparison.ts` for country-specific assumptions, input mapping, and retirement max rules
    - Add simple breakdown mapping in `components/compare/compare-breakdown.tsx` if needed
12. Add country-specific result display in `components/calculator/results/{country-code}-result-breakdown.tsx` and register it in `components/calculator/results/country-result-breakdown.tsx`. Do not add new country result blocks directly to `components/calculator/multi-country-results.tsx`.
13. **Update documentation:** Do not add country lists or country-specific sections to README. Keep country source URLs and notes near the country constants/calculator, and update AGENTS.md only when the architecture or workflow changes.

**Note:** Any time you add a new country, also update `/compare` assumptions and documentation to keep the experience consistent.

### Voluntary Contribution Checklist

Before deciding a country has no optional tax-saving inputs, explicitly check for resident tax-reducing contributions and reliefs, including:

- Pension, retirement, provident, occupational pension, and social welfare schemes
- Voluntary top-ups to mandatory retirement or savings systems
- Life/medical insurance premiums when they are user-controlled and tax-relevant
- Charitable/religious payments, education, lifestyle, or qualifying expense reliefs that are common enough to model

If a user-entered amount has an official or modeled cap, use `ContributionSlider`, expose the cap from `getContributionLimits()`, clamp the hook setter, and clamp again in the calculator. Mandatory payroll/social-insurance contributions should remain automatic calculator logic, not voluntary UI controls.

When a scheme has multiple caps, keep them separate in constants and UI copy. Use the legal contribution/payment cap as the slider max, then apply any lower tax-relief cap in the calculator and breakdown. If a complex employer-plan or plan-specific extra limit is intentionally excluded, state that exclusion near the constants and in visible assumptions copy.

For `/compare`, the "max retirement" assumption must include each modeled tax-reducing retirement contribution where the user's assumptions make them eligible. If no voluntary contribution is modeled, leave a short source-backed comment or visible assumption explaining why.

### Updating Tax Data

- Use official government sources whenever possible and verify that the tax year/assessment year matches the calculator constants.
- Preserve source URLs in constants comments when useful.
- Update visible explanatory copy when rates change:
  - `components/calculator/seo-tax-info.tsx`
  - `components/calculator/multi-country-calculator.tsx`
  - `components/calculator/results/{country-code}-result-breakdown.tsx`
  - `lib/countries/country-page-content.ts`
- Update this file only when the architecture or agent workflow changes, not for routine country additions.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` after calculation or shared UI changes.

### Parallel Agent Guidance

- Treat `lib/countries/registry.ts`, `hooks/use-multi-country-calculator.ts`, `hooks/use-country-comparison.ts`, `components/calculator/results/country-result-breakdown.tsx`, and compare breakdown mapping as shared integration points. Coordinate edits to these files when multiple agents are adding countries in parallel.
- Avoid editing README, `components/calculator/multi-country-results.tsx`, `lib/countries/currency.ts`, or shared aliases/maps in `lib/countries/types.ts` for routine country additions. Put new country type extensions in `lib/countries/{country-code}/types.ts` instead. Avoid `lib/countries/country-page-content.ts` unless a country needs custom SEO/header copy beyond the generic config-based fallback. These files are structured to derive from the registry or delegate to per-country modules.
- Country implementation directories (`lib/countries/{code}/`) are good parallel work units when each agent owns a different country.
- UI work should reuse shared field primitives first; if a new primitive is needed, add it generically and migrate obvious duplicate call sites.
- Keep country-specific legal/tax notes near the relevant constants or calculator implementation instead of adding country-specific sections to this file.

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Tailwind CSS for styling (dark theme with zinc palette)
- Functional React components with hooks
- Memoization for expensive calculations
- Well-typed interfaces for all data structures

## Testing

No test framework is currently configured. When adding tests:

- Consider Jest or Vitest for unit tests
- Focus on tax calculation accuracy
- Test edge cases for contribution limits and tax brackets

## Build Pipeline

The build uses `scripts/with-last-updated.mjs` to inject:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_TIMESTAMP` — ISO 8601 build time
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAST_UPDATED` — Last git commit date

These are displayed in the UI footer.

## Common Tasks

### Update Tax Brackets

1. Edit `lib/countries/{country}/constants/tax-brackets-{year}.ts`
2. Update `lib/constants/tax-year.ts` if changing tax year

### Add New Contribution Type

1. Update types in `lib/countries/types.ts`
2. Add calculation logic in country calculator
3. Add constants for contribution/payment caps and tax-relief caps, keeping separate caps separate in naming and calculation.
4. Add UI controls in relevant component. Use `ContributionSlider` for capped annual currency amounts and `CurrencyAmountField` only for genuinely uncapped/free-form amounts.
5. Update hook state management, clamping setters to the same max used by the UI.

### Fix Tax Calculation Bug

1. Locate calculation in `lib/countries/{country}/`
2. Check constants for correct values
3. Verify calculation formula matches tax rules
4. Test with known salary amounts

### Change Default Country

1. Edit `app/page.tsx` — change redirect target from `/us` to desired country code
